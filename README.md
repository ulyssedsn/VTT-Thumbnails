# VTT-Thumbnails

I love thumbnails, and I think that everybody needs thumbnails in his life. I have built 
for you a application that is able to generate from an mp4 file VTT Thumbnails (this
include the mosaic and the webvtt file). Enjoy !

## Installation

Use the package manager [bundler](https://bundler.io/) to install all
dependencies.

```bash
bundle install
```

## Usage

```ruby
Thumbnails.new(<mp4_file>).call
```
## WIP
 - Improve video formats support
 - Integrate a test player
